ABOUT

sctp-tools contains a simple SCTP server and SCTP client program which can be
used to send data using SCTP protocol. The programs can be used to transfer
data using both SEQPKT or STREAM type of SCTP sockets. 

LICENSING

The programs are licensed under two-clause BSD license.

BUILDING and INSTALLING

Edit the Makefile if necessary, type 'make' to compile the programs.

If you want to enable the debug information, edit src/defs.h and remove
comments around #define DEBUG. Then rebuild the application. If built with
debugging enabled, the program will write debug information to stderr.

RUNNING 

Both programs have '--help' option which should provide some information on the
available command line parameters.
